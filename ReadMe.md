# Data Pipeline for YNAB

This project is a Data Pipeline for YNAB that fetches and caches budget-related data from an API. It organizes the data into a dimensional model ready to be reported on.

## [Get Started Guide](docs/Get_Started.md)

## Usage

This tool has been desined to be used to fetch and cache budget-related data from the YNAB API. It can be used multiple times a day or once a year or anything in between. It is designed to be flexible and easy to use.
Once it is on your local machine, you can run it by executing the `main.py` file. This will handle situations where you have not run the tool before, or where you have run it before and need to update the data. It will not duplicate any data caused by running it multiple times.
